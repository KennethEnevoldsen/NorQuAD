# NorQuAD: Norwegian question answering dataset for machine reading comprehension
Machine reading comprehension is one of the key problems in natural language understanding. The question answering (QA) task requires a machine to read and comprehend a given text passage, and then answer questions about the passage. There is progress in reading comprehension and question answering for English and a few other languages. We would like to fill in the lack of annotated data for question answering for Norwegian.
This project aims at compiling human-created training, validation, and test sets for the task for Norwegian. To our knowledge this would be the first question answering dataset in Norwegian.
Creation of the dataset will be an important step for Norwegian natural language processing, considering the importance and popularity of reading comprehension and question answering tasks in the NLP community. 

The project is funded by the [Teksthub-initiative](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/kompetansehuber/teksthub/)
